            <!-- TODO: Need a contiguous subscriptable data structure -->
            <!-- TODO: Every storage location is called a "bucket" -->
              <!-- TODO: For every key, we need to know what "bucket" it goes into... -->
                <!-- TODO: To make this determination, we use a hash function, which maps a key to a particular bucket -->
                <!-- TODO: Hash functions should be cheap -->
                <!-- TODO: Hash functions should be deterministic: called with the same argument, should return the same bucket -->
              <!-- TODO: Say I had 40,000 items mapping the first 4 numbers of studentIDs to student objects (sorted by name) -->
                <!-- TODO: If I had, say, 10,000 possible combinations of the first 4 numbers of a studentID (0000 - 9999), then I'd *expect* there to be around 4 students per bucket -->
                  <!-- TODO: Problem: what if the numbers are not distributed uniformly? -->
                  <!-- TODO: Then we're sorting a ton of items into a few buckets -->
                  <!-- TODO: So, additional constraint on Hash functions is that they must uniformly distribute into buckets -->
                  <!-- TODO: In our example, this might mean using the *last* 4 numbers of a studentId instead of the first 4 -->
                <!-- TODO: What happens when I add more and more items to my hash table? Search within each bucket is actually linear because of each linked list per bucket growing to infinity -->
                <!-- TODO: Even though this has linear behavior, the constant of proportionality hides an important improvement: the constant is extremely small: 1/b where b is the number of buckets -->
                  <!-- TODO: Remember that big-O says nothing about small values of N -->
                  <!-- TODO: Also, this is true for FIXED bucket amounts only -->
              <!-- TODO: When two keys map to the same bucket, it's called a "collision" -->
              <!-- TODO: Load factor of a hash table: the number of items divided by the number of buckets -- the average linked list length -->
                <!-- TODO: Another tactic is to have a hash table with a maximum load factor such that we make more buckets as soon as we exceed that limit -->
                <!-- TODO: Doing this, we guarantee that the size of our linked lists in buckets stay pretty small, so we end up with an average and worst case constant time O(1) lookup / insertion -->
              <!-- TODO: What about sorting hash table elements? Difficult because our hash function has attempted to scatter the keys uniformly -->
                <!-- TODO: Naive solution is to step through every bucket (order of O(b)) and then sort in each bucket; b > N -->
                  <!-- TODO: Improvement: have pointers at the end of each bucket list item that point to the next in the sequence -->
                    <!-- TODO: Greater insertion and deletion complexity, but trends the time of sorting to the size of input N rather buckets b -->
                  <!-- TODO: Still, the items within each bucket are not necessarily sorted... -->
                  <!-- TODO: Solution is to have another data structure with sorted pointers to the elements: n*log(n) time (we don't want to sort at insertion because then we might as well just use a BST) -->
            <!-- TODO: Generating buckets -->
              <!-- TODO: Have a prime number of buckets such that any hash function mapping keys to buckets will still be uniform despite patterns in input ints -->
