            <div>
              <p>I've been instructed by the Professor to remind you of the class tips. Even though you are the elite discussion section, here they are again below (in red because important):</p>
              <p class='alert alert-danger'><strong>Read Things... Well</strong><br/> Make sure you're precise in your coding and your interpretations of the assignments and lectures or you will be sad.</p>
              <p class='alert alert-danger'><strong>Start Early</strong><br/> It really will take longer than you think... the rule of thumb is to multiply the time you think it will take by 3, and then ignore that figure because it will probably take longer.</p>
              <p class='alert alert-danger'><strong>Develop Incrementally</strong><br/> Add bits of code at a time, then compile, and run. You will isolate bugs more quickly and understand what your code is doing.</p>
              <small>Of course, you guys already knew that...</small>

            <div>
              <p>In order to compile code in C++, you'll need to configure what's called your development environment.</p>
              <p class='question' name='dev-env-question'><strong>Development Environment</strong><br/>What is a development environment?</p>
              <p class='answer' name='dev-env-question'><strong>Development Environment</strong></br>A collection of your chosen tools, software components, compilers, editors, etc. that you use to develop software.</p>

            <h1>A Brief Trip into Hardware</h1>
            <div>
              <p class='question' name='hardware-joke'>How many computer scientists does it take to change a lightbulb?</p>
              <p class='answer' name='hardware-joke'>None, it's a hardware problem.</p>
              <p>That said, it never hurts to know what's happening &quot;under the hood&quot; of your code, so let's take a quick detour into hardware.</p>
              <p>The following image depicts the standard Von Neumann computer architecture displaying the processor, memory, and I/O:</p>
              <div class='text-center'>
                <img src='../../../assets/images/fall-2013/cs-31/week-1/von_neumann.png' />
              </div>
              <p class='definition'><strong>Memory</strong><br/> Primary memory (RAM) is the type of hardware that contains program information for fast and active access.<br/>Secondary memory refers to other, slower-access devices like hard drives.</p>
              <p>With respect to memory, the process of programming generally follows these steps:</p>
              <ol class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>You write your source code and save it somewhere on a hard drive (secondary memory).</p></li>
                <li><p>You compile your source code into machine code, which creates another file on the hard drive.</p></li>
                <li><p>When you run your compiled machine code, the program is loaded into RAM (primary memory).</p></li>
                <li><p>The processor then performs the Fetch, Decode, Execute cycle on your program in RAM.</p></li>
              </ol>
              <p>So now let's examine what happens in the CPU by first describing its components:</p>
              <p class='question' name='architecture-q1'>What are the roles of the Control Unit and Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) aboard the CPU?</p>
              <p class='answer' name='architecture-q1'>The ALU performs any mathematical computations that are hard coded into it (addition, subtraction, negation, etc.) and the CU fetches, decodes, and executes instructions from memory and employs the ALU when an instruction requires it.</p>
              <br/>
              <h3>Fetch, Decode, Execute: The Instruction Cycle</h3>
              <p>So what happens to the code once it's been loaded into RAM? Let's look at how memory is structured.</p>
              <p>Below, you can see that each block of memory is indexed, meaning that each block is assigned a value, or address, that uniquely identifies it.</p>
              <p>You can think of blocks of memory as being boxes that each have a unique name and hold data in the form of bits.</p>
              <p class='definition'>A <strong>bit</strong> is the atomic unit of information storage in memory that is either a 0 or a 1. A <strong>byte</strong> consists of 8 bits.</p>
              <p>Each block of memory holds a byte of data. This data is just that... raw data. It is within the context of a running program and processor instructions that it gains meaning.</p>

              <p>For example, in a <strong>32-bit architecture</strong>, the smallest addressable unit in any address is 1 byte. Additionally, the CPU on a 32-bit architecture will operate on 4 bytes at a time, or 4 consecutive memory addresses. So, above, a single instruction might include memory blocks 0, 1, 2, and 3 on a 32-bit machine.</p>
              <p class='example'>In a 32-bit architecture, a single word might look like:<br/><br/>10000111110001000100111110101001<br/><br/>In many architectures, (and without diving into detail) the first 5 bits will map to an instruction (like add, negate), and the rest of the bit string will indicate arguments to that instruction.</p>
              <p class='question' name='memory-q2'>On how many bytes will a CPU of a 64-bit architecture operate at a time?</p>
              <p class='answer' name='memory-q2'>8 bytes.</p>
              <p class='definition'><strong>Fetch:</strong> The Control Unit pulls 4 or 8 bytes of data from memory depending on whether it's a 32- or 64-bit architecture.</p>
              <p class='definition'><strong>Decode:</strong> The Control Unit then determines what instruction is in the newly fetched data.</p>
              <p class='definition'><strong>Execute:</strong> The Control Unit executes the newly decoded instruction, often using the ALU for methods like addition and moving memory blocks around. After execution, the Control Unit will fetch the next instruction, restarting the cycle.</p>
              <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Your program gets thrown into main memory when it's run, after which the CPU will successively execute the instructions in machine code until it is done.</p>

              <p>In programming, variables are not much different, except that I need to specify what kind of variable I'm using.</p>
              <p>Variables can be of a variety of types, whether it's an integer number (no decimal), a decimal number, a string of characters, etc.</p>
              <p class='toolkit'><strong>Variable Declaration</strong><br/>When we want to name a variable and use it in our program, we declare it using the following syntax:<br/>&lt;type&gt; &lt;name&gt;;<br/>Optionally, we can assign a value to our variable when we declare it (see below).</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  // Declaring a variable of type int 
  // means that it is an integer with no decimal

  // We can also declare multiple variables at once

            <div>
              <p>Just because your code compiles and runs doesn't mean that you're really coding well. Here are some great practices to help you throughout your career.</p>
              
              <h3>Comment Before You Code</h3>
              <p class='toolkit'><strong>Comments</strong><br/>Comments are parts of the source code that are included mostly for human readability and information, but are ignored by the compiler and during runtime.</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;
  using namespace std;
  
  int main () {
      // Here is an example of a line-item comment
      // Anything after the two slashes is ignored
      
      /*
       * Here is an example of a block comment
       * Anything between the first slash-asterisk and
       * asterisk-slash is ignored. The asterisks on
       * the left are for aesthetic appeal only
       */
      
      // This program sucks and does nothing
  }
</pre>
              <p>Often, when approaching a tough programming assignment, it is easy to get lost in your own code or even your own logic.</p>
              <p>Instead, try to put the code into plain English first, and then go back and translate. This will help with incremental development as well.</p>
              <p class='example'>Try to use the Comment Before You Code technique in designing the following program: an application that prompts the user for their birthday and then reports it back to them.</p>
