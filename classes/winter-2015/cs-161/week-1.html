            <h1>A Glance at AI</h1>
            <div>
              <p>So you're in an AI class... what exactly is Artificial Intelligence, aside from what will ultimately replace the human race?</p>
              <p>AI has many branches and facets, so a single definition is difficult; that said, we can say, generally, that:</p>
              <p class='definition'><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> is the attempt to automate the intelligent processes we often attribute to biological organisms (usually humans).</p>
              <br/>
              
              <p>Tasks that humans perform daily are actually quite non-trivial for computers.</p>
              <p class='question' name='intro-q0'>What are some tasks at which humans excel over computers?</p>
              <div class='answer' name='intro-q0'>
                <p>Here are some sub-fields of AI devoted to such tasks:</p>
                <br/>
                <ul class='indent-1'>
                  <li><p><strong>Natural Language Processing (covered with some focus in this course):</strong> Emulating human communication</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> Emulating human sight</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Expert Systems / Expert Diagnosis:</strong> Emulating human reasoning from evidence and uncertainty</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Game Playing / Planning:</strong> Emulating human planning</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Robotics:</strong> Emulating human movement and physical interaction</p></li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <br/>
              
              <p>...and these are just a few applications!</p>
              <p>Indeed, AI need not be applied, necessarily; philosophers have long debated the nature of intelligence and whether or not man has the capacity to reproduce it artificially.</p>
              <p>We'll leave most of that philosophy stuff to north campus, though... this class will deal primarily with the technical aspects of AI.</p>
              
              <br/>
              <h3>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
              <p>Because this course dives most heavily into NLP, it's fair to take a quick look at it now.</p>
              <p class='definition'><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong> is a subfield of AI concerned with extracting meaning from text and speech.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>Firstly, NLP in its entirety has not yet been solved; there are many nuances of language that computers just don't understand.</p>
              <p>That said, history has provided us with a few main approaches to NLP, each with some strengths and weaknesses:</p>
              <table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
                <thead>
                  <th><p><strong>Approach</strong></p></th>
                  <th><p><strong>Description</strong></p></th>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <th><p>Symbolic</p></th>
                    <td><p>[Top-down] Use known grammatical rules and structures to impose patterns on text and extract meaning by exploiting how humans typically format their text.</p></td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th><p>Statistical / Empirical</p></th>
                    <td><p>[Bottom-up] Use patterns found within text itself and try to generate rules from large corpuses of sentences.</p></td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th><p>Both!</p></th>
                    <td><p>Most modern systems will incorporate sentence structure and known rules into its probabilistic analyses, combining both of the above methodologies.</p></td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
              <br/>
              <p>NLP is also one of the oldest problems in AI, so old, in fact, that one of the fathers of computer science (Alan Turing) described a metric for our language-processing automata:</p>
              <p class='definition'>
                The <strong>Turing Test</strong> is a game described by Alan Turing whereby human judges attempt to discern whether an unseen (text) conversational partner is a machine or another human.
              </p>
              <br/>
              
              <p>The game, as Turing described it, goes something like this:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>A human judge (the interlocutor) engages in conversation between two entities that are located in separate rooms.*</p></li>
                <li><p>The judge spends 5 minutes (some historians argue it was 10) talking to each entity via text-message, knowing that one of the two must be a computer.</p></li>
                <li><p>After talking to both entities, the judge must decide which conversational partner was the human, and which was the computer.</p></li>
              </ul>
              <br/>
              <p>An intelligent agent is said to have &quot;passed&quot; the Turing test if it fools at least 30% of its human judges into thinking that it too is human.</p>
              <p class='definition'>
                * [Trivia] Turing, in the 1950 paper that introduced what is now considered the classic Turing test, noted that the separate rooms must be ESP-proof so that the judge could not deduce
                which room held the computer by means of psychic prowess (hey, it was the 50s give him a break)
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p>A variety of programs have claimed to have passed the Turing test, but many of these findings are dubious.</p>
              <p>
                Widely regarded as the gold standard of modern Turing Test evaluation, <a href='http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html' target='_blank'>the Loebner Prize</a>
                is an annual competition where programmers submit their chatbots to vie for the $100,000 grand prize for being &quot;indistinguishable from a human.&quot;
              </p>
              <p>
                The Loebner Prize competition is the formal Turing Test instantiation, and has not yet been passed (although its constraints are significantly more difficult: e.g., 25 minutes of conversation
                as opposed to Turing's proposed 5 minutes)
              </p>
              <p>There are variants on the Turing Test as well:</p>

              <br/>
              <h3>Modified Turing Tests</h3>
              <p>Modern AI evaluators have claimed that the original Turing Test has too many constraints, including, but not limited to:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>The fact that the human judge is aware that they may be interacting with a computer and take steps to fool it that would not normally follow in conversation.</p></li>
                <li><p>
                  The fact that the computer is often simply being asked questions with dialogue that has been initiated by the judge (why not give the computer a chance to ask a question / respond?)
                </p></li>
                <li><p>The fact that the Turing test does not take other human communicative mechanisms into account (e.g., body language, tone, cadence, etc.)</p></li>
              </ul>
              <br/>
              <p>When some of these constraints are relaxed, even very simple chatbots have completed modified Turing tests...</p>
              <p>(Shameless plug for my own undergrad chatbot, (Gilbert &amp; Forney, in press))</p>
              
              <br/>
              <h3>Summary</h3>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>NLP is hard...</p></li>
                <li><p>...so hard that a (version of a) test for computer intelligence proposed over 50 years ago still hasn't been satisfactorily met.</p></li>
                <li><p>Some, constrained, versions of the Turing test have been passed, though those studies are generally not... generalizable.</p></li>
                <li><p>There are a variety of different approaches to NLP each with their own strengths and weaknesses, some of which we'll discuss in this course</p></li>
              </ul>
              <br/>
              <p>Then, of course, there's the end-all, be-all of Turing Tests:</p>

            <h1>An Introduction to LISP</h1>
            <div>
              <p>For this course, we'll be using the LISP programming language.</p>
              <p class='definition'><strong>LISP</strong> is a LISt Processing programming language, often mocked for its &quot;Lots of Insipid, Stupid Parentheses&quot;</p>
              <br/>
              <p>Why LISP for AI?</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>LISP syntax is tree-oriented (and therefore, recursion oriented), which is useful for NLP and many other tree-based operations</p></li>
                <li><p>Because of its tree-like properties, making proofs and algorithmic analysis is simplified</p></li>
                <li><p>LISP boasts interchangability of data and program code, which allows for ease of self-modifying behavior</p></li>
              </ul>
              <br/>
              <p class='definition'><strong>There are a variety of different LISP implementations.</strong> This class, and guide, describes the Common LISP variant.</p>
              
              <br/>
              <h3>Atom &amp; Eval</h3>
              <p>Get it? Because we're starting with the basics? :/</p>
              <p class='toolkit'><strong>Atoms</strong> are simple data types in LISP such as numbers and strings. These are indivisible into smaller components, thus the name.</p>
              <p class='toolkit'><strong>Symbols</strong> are atoms that can refer to functions and variables.</p>
              <p>In this way, all symbols are atoms, but not all atoms are necessarily symbols.</p>
              <br/>
              <p class='debug'>NOTE: Symbols are case-insensitive, which means that a symbol representing some function called SYMBOL-ENOUGH is equivalent to referencing the same function SyMbOl-EnOuGh</p>
              <br/>
              <p>If a symbol is defined, then it can be evaluated (like a function name used to evaluate its definition), otherwise, you'll get an error.</p>
              <p class='toolkit'>A <strong>list</strong> is a sequence of atoms and other (recursively defined) lists.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>Because everything is a list in LISP, that means we can have two different list interpretations:</p>
              <table class='table table-bordered table-striped'>
                <thead>
                  <tr>
                    <th><p>Interpretation</p></th>
                    <th><p>Syntax</p></th>
                  </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <th><p>Lists as code</p></th>
                    <td><p>Almost all LISP expressions will match the following format:</p><br/>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  (function-name argument1 argument2 ... argumentN)
</pre>
                      <p>Where &quot;function-name&quot; is a symbol designating a function definition, followed by a space-separated list of its arguments.</p>
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th><p>Lists as data</p></th>
                    <td><p>If you would like a list of data elements, you simply prepend a list using a single quote:<br/>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  '(item1 item2 ... itemN)
</pre>
                    </p></td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
              <br/>
              <p class='definition'>All lists are in the form of Polish Prefix notation, and are evaluated from left to right; atoms evaluate to themselves.</p>
              
              <br/>
              <h3>Basic Arithmetic Operators</h3>
              <div class='toolkit'><p>The following symbols serve as LISP's basic arithmetic operators:</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; Addition
  (+ arg1 arg2 ...)
  
  ;; Subtraction
  (- arg1 arg2 ...)
  
  ;; Multiplication
  (* arg1 arg2 ...)
  
  ;; Floating-point Division
  ;; Returns a ratio when arguments are ints
  (/ arg1 arg2 ...)
  
  ;; Modulus
  (mod arg1 arg2 ...)
  
  ;; Floor / Ceiling / Round
  (floor arg1)
  (ceiling arg1)
  (round arg1)
</pre>
              </div>
              <p class='example'>Let's start off simple; what will the following LISP expressions evaluate to?</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; #1
  (+ 1 2 3)
  
  ;; #2
  (* 1 (- 1 2 1) 3)
  
  ;; #3
  (* (/ 1 2) (/ 1.0 2))
  
  ;; #4
  (* (/ 1 2) (/ 1 2))
</pre>
              <br/>
              <p>Now, remember we said that LISP treats lists as code and data differently? Well there's a conversion!</p>
              <p class='toolkit'>The <strong>eval</strong> function converts a data list into a code list.</p>
              <br/>
              <p class='example'>What will the following code print out?</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; #1
  (mod (eval '(* 1 2 3)) (- 3 1))
  
  ;; #2
  '(* 1 2 3)
  
  ;; #3
  '(eval '(* 1 2 3))
</pre>

              <br/>
              <h3>Boolean Logic</h3>
              <p class='toolkit'>In terms of LISP boolean logic, there are two atomic values: <code class='prettyprint'>nil</code> (false) and <code class='prettyprint'>t</code> (true)</p>
              <p class='definition'>ANYTHING non-nil is considered true, except for the empty list <code class='prettyprint'>()</code> which is also considered nil.</p>
              <br/>
              <div class='toolkit'><p>Here are some basic boolean operators at your disposal:</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; Negation (Unary)
  (not arg)
  
  ;; Logical AND
  (and arg1 arg2 ... argN)
  
  ;; Logical OR
  (or arg1 arg2 ... argN)
</pre>
              </div>
              <br/>
              <p>There are some peculiarities with AND and OR:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>If a logical AND returns true, then it will return the LAST true element of its argument list.</p></li>
                <li><p>If a logical OR returns true, then it will return the FIRST true element of its argument list.</p></li>
              </ul>
              <br/>
              <p class='example'>What will the following code print out?</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; #1
  (not (mod 2 2))
  
  ;; #2
  (and (* 2 2) t nil)
  
  ;; #3
  (and (* 2 2) t 3)
  
  ;; #4
  (or (* 2 2) t nil)
</pre>

              <br/>
              <h3>Numerical Comparators</h3>
              <p>Everyone's favorite numerical comparators return in LISP:</p>
              <div class='toolkit'>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; Numerical equivalence
  (= n1 n2 ...)
  
  ;; Less than
  (&lt; n1 n2 ...)
  
  ;; Less than or equal
  (&lt;= n1 n2 ...)
  
  ;; Greater than
  (&gt; n1 n2 ...)
  
  ;; Greater than or equal
  (&gt;= n1 n2 ...)
</pre>
              </div>
              <br/>
              <p>NOTE: You can provide more than 2 arguments to each comparator, in which case an expression like:</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  (&gt; n1 n2 n3)
</pre>
              <p>...will return true if and only if n1 &gt; n2 &gt; n3</p>
              <p class='example'>What will the following code print out?</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; #1
  (&gt;= (+ 1 2) 3 4)
  
  ;; #2
  (= 1 1.0)
  
  ;; #3
  (= 0.25 1/4)
</pre>

              <br/>
              <h3>List Accessors</h3>
              <p>As we know, lists in LISP are just as you'd expect: each cell of a list can contain an atom, or another list!</p>
              <p class='example'>Observe the depiction of the following list's cells:</p>
              <div class='text-center fit-pres'>
                <img src="../../../assets/images/spring-2014/cs-161/week-1/lisp-0.PNG" />
              </div>
              <div class='toolkit'><p>You can use <strong>list element accessors</strong> to get the contents of a list's cells; these include:</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; Get the first element of list L
  (first L)
  
  ;; Get the second element of list L
  (second L)
  
  ;; Get a *sublist* of the last 
  ;; element of list L
  (last L)
  
  ;; Get the nth element of list L
  ;; (indexed starting at 0)
  (nth n L)
  
  ;; Get the sublist in L composed of all
  ;; elements except for the first
  (rest L)
  
  ;; Get the sublist of L composed of all
  ;; elements except for the first n (count
  ;; of n, not the index)
  (nthcdr n L)
</pre>
              </div>
              <br/>
              <p class='example'>What will the following code print out?</p>

  (first '(1 2 3 4))
  
  ;; #2
  (rest '(&quot;this&quot; &quot;example&quot; &quot;rocks&quot;))
  
  ;; #3
  (nthcdr 2 '(2 4 6 8))
  
  ;; #4
  (nth 2 '(2 4 (6 7) 8))
</pre>

              <br/>
              <h3>List Manipulation</h3>
              <p>So we've looked at how to get things out of lists, but how about constructing them from different atoms and lists?</p>
              <p class='toolkit'>The <code class='prettyprint'>cons</code> function returns a list composed of the first element (exactly) with the elements of the 2nd argument &quot;tacked on&quot; after.</p>
              <p>Generally, we use cons to prepend an atom to the front of a list. For example:</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; Any list L is equivalent to:
  (cons (first L) (rest L))
</pre>
              <br/>
              <p>This one's a bit tricky; let's examine the outcomes of its different arguments:</p>
              <table class='table table-bordered'>
                <thead>
                  <tr>
                    <th><p>Using <code class='prettyprint'>cons</code></p></th>
                    <th><p>Second Argument: Atom</p></th>
                    <th><p>Second Argument: List</p></th>
                  </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <th><p>First Argument: Atom</p></th>
                    <td class='warning'>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; OK, but might not
  ;; be what you want...
  (cons 1 2)
  
  ;; (1 . 2)
</pre>
                    </td>
                    <td>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  (cons 5 '(6 7))
  
  ;; (5 6 7)
</pre>
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th><p>First Argument: List</p></th>
                    <td class='warning'>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; OK, but might not 
  ;; be what you want...
  (cons '(1 2) 3)
  
  ;; ((1 2) . 3)
</pre>
                    </td>
                    <td>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  (cons '(1 2) '(3 4))
  
  ;; ((1 2) 3 4)
</pre>
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
              <br/>
              <p>So what does the period mean when you see it in a list?</p>
              <p>It is essentially a symbol representing the cons operation. For example:</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  '(1 2 3 4)
  
  ;; is equivalent to:
  '(1 . (2 3 4))
  
  ;; also equivalent to:
  '(1 . (2 . (3 4)))
  
  ;; also equivalent to:
  (cons 1 (cons 2 '(3 4)))
</pre>
              <br/>
              <p>Be wary of this symbol in your code! It probably means you tried to cons something that you didn't mean to... instead, you'll probably want one of the operations discussed in the next section.</p>
              <p>One final note, observe the following special behavior of cons involving nil:</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; #1
  (cons nil 5)
  
  ;; #2
  (cons 5 nil)
</pre>
              
              <br/>
              <p class='toolkit'>The <code class='prettyprint'>list</code> operation creates a new list with all i arguments as the ith elements of that new list.</p>
              <br/>
              <p class='example'>What does the following code print out?</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; #1
  (list 1 2 3)
  
  ;; #2
  (list 1 '(2 3))
  
  ;; #3
  (list (cons 1 '(2 3)) (cons 4 '(5)))
</pre>
              
              <br/>
              <p class='toolkit'>The <code class='prettyprint'>append</code> function takes the elements of each argument list and embeds them at the end of the previous argument list.</p>
              <br/>
              <p class='prettyprint'>What does the following code print out?</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; #1
  (append '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6))
  
  ;; #2
  (append (list 1 2 3) (cons 4 '(5 6)))
  
  ;; #3
  (append (list 1 2 3) '(4 5) '((6 7)) )
</pre>
              <br/>
              <p class='definition'>NOTE: Appending nil to a list will not change that list. Very useful!</p>

              <br/>
              <h3>Utility Functions</h3>
              <p class='toolkit'>You can use the <code class='prettyprint'>length</code> function to determine the size of a list.</p>
              <p class='toolkit'>You can use the <code class='prettyprint'>null</code> function to determine if a list is the empty list.</p>
              <br/>

            <div>
              <p>Are we having fun yet?</p>
              <p>Let's look at some more advanced LISP stuff; this is where it really gets interesting...</p>
              
              <br/>
              <h3>Variables</h3>
              <p class='toolkit'>LISP <strong>variables</strong> are just like any other in your programming language of choice, except they can be used to represent any data type dynamically.</p>
              <p>There are two primary means of instantiating variables:</p>
              <table class='table table-bordered'>
                <thead>
                  <tr>

                  </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <th><p><code class='prettyprint'>setq</code></p></th>
                    <td>
                      <p>The <code class='prettyprint'>setq</code> operation is a global binding of a symbol to some definition.</p>
                      <p class='debug'>You should almost never use this for your functions in class, or really ever outside of a testing framework! It is evil!</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; Syntax:
  (setq sym1 def1 ... symN defN)
  ;; Returns defN
</pre>
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <th><p><code class='prettyprint'>let (or let*)</code></p></th>
                    <td>
                      <p>The <code class='prettyprint'>let (or let*)</code> operations provide local variable definitions, and are only defined in their scope.</p>
                      <p>These are what you shall use almost exclusively in your work.</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; Syntax:
  (let* ((sym1 def1) (sym2 def2) ... (symN defN))
    expression1
    ...
    expressionM
  )
  ;; Returns value of expressionM
</pre>
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
              <br/>
              <p>Let's look at some examples of each:</p>
              <p class='example'>What will the following code print out?</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  (setq
    lame 5
    example '(1 2 3)
  )
  
  ;; NOTE: setq returns the value
  ;; of the last instantiated variable
  
  (+ lame (first example))
</pre>
              <p>Again, avoid using setq in your assignments; you may use it for test code!</p>
              <br/>
              <p>Now, I know what your next question is: What's the difference between <code class='prettyprint'>let</code> and <code class='prettyprint'>let*</code>?</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>
                  <code class='prettyprint'>let</code> performs variable instantiation <strong>in parallel (at the same time)</strong> so if there's any dependence between instantiations,
                  you'll get an error
                </p></li>
                <li><p><code class='prettyprint'>let*</code> performs variable instantiation <strong>in sequence (one after the next)</strong>, useful for dependence between instantiations.</p></li>
              </ul>
              <p class='example'>Observe the difference between the two below:</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; [X] ERROR: Will not work because
  ;; Y relies on X and the let operation
  ;; instantiates in parallel
  (let ( (X 5) (Y (+ X 5)) )
    ;; ...
  )
  
  ;; [!] OK: Will work because
  ;; Y relies on X and the let* operation
  ;; instantiates X first, and then Y
  (let* ( (X 5) (Y (+ X 5)) )
    ;; ...
  )
</pre>
              <p class='definition'>Both versions of <code class='prettyprint'>let</code> will return the last expression mentioned in the block.</p>

              <br/>
              <h3>Control</h3>
              <p>Because we'll be using recursion almost exclusively in our work, we'll need some means of performing different actions based on different states.</p>
              <p>We use the following control syntax to decide what to do based on the state of our function inputs:</p>
              <p class='toolkit'>The <code class='prettyprint'>cond</code> (conditional) operator performs the code block of its first non-nil case.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>The syntax of a <code class='prettyprint'>cond</code> statement is as follows:</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  (cond 
    ((case1) expr1_1 expr1_2 ...)
    ((case2) expr2_1 expr2_2 ...)
    ...
    ((caseN) exprN_1 exprN_2 ...)
  )
</pre>
              <p>The above says, &quot;Starting at case1, keep trying to find a case that returns t, and if so, execute those expressions. If no case returns t, then return nil at the end of the cond.&quot;</p>
              <p class='example'>What will the following code print out?</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  (let* ( (X 5) (Y '(X 6 7)) )
    (cond
      ; Case 1:
      ((&gt; X (nth 1 Y)) '(1) )
      
      ; Case 2:
      ((&lt; X (second Y)) '(2) )
    )
  )
</pre>
              
              <br/>
              <h3>Functions</h3>
              <p>Now that we have variables and control flow, it's time to get down to functions...</p>
              <p>Here is the canonical prototye for a function definition:</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
  ;; Top level function comment
  ;; (I like 2 semicolons)
  (defun function-name (param1 param2 ... paramN)
    ; Local variable definitions
    (let* (
      (local1 def1)
      (local2 def2) )
      ...
      (cond
        ; Inline case explanation 1
        ((case1) exp1 ...)
        
        ; Inline case explanation 1
        ((case2) exp2 ...)

            <h1>LISP Typical Workflow</h1>
            <div>
              <p>There are a few tips and tricks using CLISP to help with your testing and development.</p>
              <p>I assume, in this section of the guide, that you are working from the CLISP command line / terminal interface.</p>
              <p>Your workflow for assignments will go something like this:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>Use whatever IDE or text editor you'd like for developing with LISP, and you will save files with .lsp extension.</p></li>
                <li>
                  <p>Perhaps you have a file with your functions called &quot;funcs.lsp&quot;. If you want to test your functions in another test file, you can load them using:</p>
                  <ul class='indent-1'>
                    <li><p><code class='prettyprint'>(load &quot;source.lsp&quot;)</code></p></li>
                    <li><p><code class='prettyprint'>(load &quot;source.lsp&quot; :compiling t)</code> - This CLISP specific command will compile your code before running, which might catch more bugs</p></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><p>Within your interpreter, you can change directory to the location of your LISP files:</p>
                  <ul class='indent-1'>
                    <li><p><code class='prettyprint'>(cd)</code> - Lists your current directory</p></li>
                    <li><p><code class='prettyprint'>(cd &quot;directory&quot;)</code> - Changes to the given directory</p></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><p>You can then run any of your files in the current directory by typing:</p>
                  <ul class='indent-1'>
                    <li><p><code class='prettyprint'>clisp &quot;source.lsp&quot;</code> - Runs your code</p></li>
                    <li><p><code class='prettyprint'>clisp -c &quot;source.lsp&quot;</code> - [optional] Compiles your code for more robust error checking</p></li>
                    <li><p><code class='prettyprint'>clisp -i &quot;source.lsp&quot;</code> - Loads your code and then enters into the interpreter</p></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <br/>
              <h3>Debugging</h3>
              <p>Here are a couple of helpful functions you might find useful during debugging!</p>
              <p class='toolkit'>The <code class='prettyprint'>trace</code> function will print out a trace of each recursive call to the provided function name.</p>

  ; Stops tracing the call stack of
  ; the power function
  (untrace power)
  
  ; Alternately:
  (untrace)
  ; Will stop tracing all functions

              <br/>
              <p class='toolkit'>Use the <code class='prettyprint'>print</code> function to return the value of its argument, as well as print that argument to the console.</p>
              <p class='toolkit'>Use the <code class='prettyprint'>format</code> function to print a formatted string with all instances of ~S replaced, in order, by its arguments (see example below)</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
