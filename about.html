            <strong>Undergraduate</strong>
            <p>
              As a southern-Californian, born and raised, it's been pretty tough to leave paradise behind for education and employment alike... So I decided not to! My undergraduate career took place
              at Loyola Marymount University (just a few miles south of UCLA) where I studied computer science, psychology, and a little pure mathematics for good measure. During my tenure at LMU, I developed
              a passion for studying artificial agents, their interaction with humans, and the formal mechanisms that drive them. My theses at LMU concerted elements of cognitive psychology with artificial
              intelligence; I continue research along this vein with professors at LMU to this day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Related to the study of artificial agents, I am also a board member for the Immersive Education Initiative (iED West Coast Chapter), where I serve to organize conferences for, and examine
              the leading technologies in, immersive electronic devices and applications for improving education. I became involved with the organization at LMU through collaboration with the iED West Chair,
              Dr. Richard Gilbert.

            <strong>Graduate</strong>
            <p>
              If my work in undergrad produced the "What" of my interests in artificial agents, then my graduate work is a study of the "How." At UCLA, I'm a member of the Cognitive Systems Laboratory under the
              advisement of Dr. Judea Pearl, studying a field in artificial intelligence known as Causal Reasoning. In particular, I'm examining how machines learn in terms of cause-and-effect, and how
              quantifying this cognitive task can lead to advances in reasoning systems. Formally and currently, I study causal analyses in sequential decision problems: how machines learn over time.

            <strong>Future Directions</strong>
            <p>
              I hope to continue research in cognitive systems and apply causal theory to interactive, intelligent agents. I also truly enjoy teaching and would thoroughly enjoy a professorship once my
              graduate education is complete. Look for me in the future; short of a professorship, Forney Industries might soon be a household name...
